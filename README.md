## Response (What I Find Interesting)
### The article by Dustin Volz “Biden Administration Forms Cybersecurity Review Board to Probe Failures” from the Wall Street Journal discusses an approach that the United States government is taking to boost Cyber Resilience. As a cybersecurity minor, I found the roles and responsibilities assigned to this new task force interesting. First, I was surprised that it wasn't an independent taskforce–which would give it more transparency and accountability. Secondly, I thought it was unique that the board was not focused on assigning fault for cyber attacks that occur, but rather is simply focused on finding solutions against cyber threats on a whole. While this is indeed useful, it does not further incentivise private companies to do their part (or risk penalty) as they aren't being directly investigated. However, I believe that this task force at the end of the day will be beneficial as it will provide developers guidance on how to harden their products against emerging cyber threats when developing software.

### As Keshnen mentioned in his response on the article by Volz, I find the creation of a new task force to facilitate major cybersecurity failures by simply finding solutions against the cyber threat instead of locating the faults from which these cyber security threats source an interesting and unique choice.

### Personally felt that the article chosen by Keshnen gives some crucial information regarding the cybersecurity laws. It was surprising to know that the ecosystem did not comprise of a baord that combined the expertise of government officials and private-sector researchers to study high-profile cybersecurity episodes has been missing up until now.
